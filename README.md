# plop
This is the repository for plop.
Download the gui_plop_setup.exe and execute it. Current version is 3.0.6.
<https://github.com/davidlewistoronto/plop/blob/main/gui_plop_setup.exe>

If you downloaded this before Mar 5, 2021, note that I had accidentally stored an old version 3.0.4 under the distribution,
and it has been updated to 3.0.6 which is the most recent version.


New: A manual is available under https://github.com/davidlewistoronto/plop/blob/main/Plop%20Users%20Manual.pdf
This only contains a quick start that should be sufficient for most ATMs who just want to design a conventional cell.
More will be added over time. The older manual focuses on the command line version of Plop and explains more of the concepts.
