New: A manual is available under https://github.com/davidlewistoronto/plop/blob/main/Plop%20Users%20Manual.pdf
This only contains a quick start that should be sufficient for most ATMs who just want to design a conventional cell.
More will be added over time. The older manual focuses on the command line version of Plop and explains more of the concepts.
